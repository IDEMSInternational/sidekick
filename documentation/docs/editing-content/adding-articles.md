The docJSON within the linked Google Sheet will determine which sections can be added to the document.

Within each Article displayed within the side menu, an 'Add Section' button will appear with all the available sections to add. Adding a section will add the selected section to the bottom of that section within that article.

Users can add sections manually, although using the menu will ensure the header and table is added correctly.

**_Note: All sections for the selected article will be validated when a new section is added_**

**_Note: Articles within the side menu can be refreshed by clicking the REFRESH button in 'ARTICLES' tab_**
