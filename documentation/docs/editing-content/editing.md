# Editing content
All content can be added directly within the document without using the side menu. To make sure this is done safely a few rules must be followed.
- Articles must have a unique id/name that is of type **Heading1**
- Article headers must be directly followed by a table that contains the article data
- Section Types must be of type **Subtitle**
- Section data must be within a table under the Section Subtitle
- The first column of all data tables must contain the field names
- The first table must be the METADATA table as mentioned in **Set up**
